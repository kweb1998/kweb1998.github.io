      <h1>About me!</h1>
      <p>Back then, people had come to this city with a purpose. They called it, “the land of opportunity”. A place where people come from far away places, either on boats, planes, you name it. NY is a place that can jumpstart your career. From the moment you step onto this fine land, your New York Experience has just started. My dad’s New York Experience started the moment he and his family landed at JFK. I remember how he told us about the shops and restaurants he went to in Richmond Hill. The old house he used to have on 116th street, and the amazing fond memories he had with his family in Richmond Hill. Richmond Hill reminded him of being back home.</p>
      <p2>When it comes to Richmond Hill, you often think about the culture that is within. From the music that blasts throughout the streets, vibrating upon people’s windows, and making car alarms go off. From the smell of the spiciest, flavorful food that indicates your neighbor’s cooking in their backyard. Richmond Hill is a place that makes you feel like you're back home in the caribbean. You wouldn't even need a flight to experience the culture. Everything is located within this beautiful city.  For the people of Richmond Hill, everything is located within Liberty Ave. This street has basically all the necessities to make you feel back at home. Shops and flea markets flock with customers that search for items that couldn’t be found at ordinary supermarkets. Restaurants flock with people willing to take some hot and pleasant food home with them. Clothing stores on Liberty Ave flock with customers willing to buy a nice, colorful dress for a family function, or wedding.</p2>
